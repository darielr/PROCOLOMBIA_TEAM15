They employ approximately 59,900 people and their operations include approximately 1,100 facilities and 12,000 vehicles.  Brink's was founded in 1859 and their headquarters are located in Richmond, Virginia.  Brink's was founded in Chicago on May 5, 1859 when Perry Brink purchased a horse-drawn wagon and made his first delivery. The wagon bore his new company's name â€“ Brink's City Express. Chicago was booming, fueled by new railroads built to exploit the growing economy of the surrounding Midwestern U.S. With railroads came manufacturers, distributors, banks and insurance companies, all of whom attracted business travelers to the new city. In the early days, Brink used his single wagon to transport travelers' luggage between Chicago rail stations and hotels.  In 1860, Brink's employees delivered luggage and parcels during the Republican National Convention, where an estimated 50,000 delegates and spectators assembled to see local dark-horse candidate Abraham Lincoln win the nomination over other contenders.  In 1871, the Great Chicago fire destroyed some 18,000 buildings, including the headquarters of Brink's City Express. Miraculously, Brink's horses and wagons were saved and the company was back in operation within a week. As Chicago recovered, Brink's grew. By 1872, Brink's ran 20 wagons to every part of the city three times a day and had begun service to the prosperous new suburbs. The company advertised fees less than those of competitors: 25 cents to deliver a trunk from a train station to anywhere in the city.;561621 - Security Systems Services (except Locksmiths);Argentina,Austria,Estados Unidos de América,Australia,Japón,Suiza,Bahréin,Botsuana,India,Turquía,Países Bajos,Chile,Taiwán,Dinamarca,Israel,Hungría,Francia,Canadá,Emiratos Árabes Unidos,Grecia,Hong Kong,Luxemburgo,Reino Unido,Colombia,Jordania,China,México,Bélgica,Irlanda,Alemania,RusiaVietnam,Corea del SurBolivia,Sudáfrica,Italia,Mongolia,SingapurRumanía,Polonia,Polonia;41;5

351;GIBSON, DUNN & CRUTCHER;4.0;169050000.0;1077.0;"From one practice group to another, from one generation to the next, there is something unique in the halls at Gibson Dunn: a seamless commitment to excellence that has continued for over a century by an elite group of lawyers who come to serve their clients selflessly and to achieve results. This is our story.  In May 1872, a tall, 34 year-old, red-bearded lawyer stepped down from the stage-coach at the Plaza of Los Angeles. Corporate attorney John Bicknell had his sights on building a law practice. What greeted him at the stage was a humble little pueblo with dusty unpaved street, no industry and scant business.  He saw a pueblo of narrow streets and alleys between decrepit adobe buildings roofed with ''brea'' from tar pits west of the city. Bicknell, who had summed up his philosophy this way when counseling a younger lawyer, ''The safe way is to select a business that you will be satisfied to follow and build up a business of your own.'' He began to follow his own advice. By the 1880s, he had attracted one of the region's most important clients, the Southern Pacific Railroad.  It took time to select a quality partner. But in 1890, Bicknell, a Republican, teamed with Walter Trask, a Democratic litigator, thus launching the unbroken chain of partnership that today is Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. Also launched was a set of unique firm attributes. Those included selecting only quality lawyers; balancing ideas across the political spectrum; and providing powerful resources in both transactional and litigation-related legal services. More than a century later, these attributes still define today's Gibson Dunn.  In 1897 Judge James Gibson joined the firm, thus instituting another Gibson Dunn tradition â€“ hiring lawyers who make an impact in their communities. In 1903, in a move that created the largest firm in Los Angeles, Bicknell, Trask and Gibson merged their practice with that of former Los Angeles City Attorney William Dunn and former Assistant City Attorney Albert Crutcher. Carried out at the behest of a client in order to create a ''full-service'' firm, the combination was called an ''experiment'' in the local press. It has worked ever since. Nearly 100 years later, the press recently dubbed the firm ''The Rescue Squad'' for its response and service to clients in legal need. Another article remarked that it remains easier to get into the CIA than to become a lawyer at Gibson Dunn.  The firm grew as the region grew, into both Northern and Southern California, and both nationally and internationally. By the 1970s, Gibson Dunn had offices in London and Paris. Shortly thereafter, the firm took the bold step of launching its practice in the nation's capital and New York. Since 2000, the firm has further expanded in Europe, South America, the Middle East and Asia. As John Bicknell might say, the firm has ''built up a business'', based on those attributes of quality, balance and impact and on an unrelenting mission of achieving success for clients â€“ a mission shared today by approximately 1000 lawyers worldwide.";541110 - Offices of Lawyers;Estados Unidos de América;1;0

They have harnessed the cumulative expertise of their entire team to build a set of processes and systems that they utilize everyday to improve the performance of their customers' supply chain.  Riverwood Solutions is a company founded on the principal that strong, effective execution of legitimate expertise in manufacturing, supply chain, and product operations, can be the life blood of successful organizations and often makes the difference between a product's, even a company's, ultimate success or failure.  Their team has successfully launched and managed hundreds or products globally - and they have also witnessed, firsthand, production and supply chain failures resulting from poor planning and execution. The failure to appropriately manage a single component costing less than a penny can doom to failure the launch or ongoing delivery of an OEM product worth tens of thousands of dollars. Riverwood Solutions' team understands that in operations and supply chain - the devil is not only in the detail, but in the effective execution of the detail.;541618 - Other Management Consulting Services;Estados Unidos de América;1;0

1222;GREEN DOT CORPORATION;1.0;890151000.0;1152.0;Green Dot Corporation is a provider of retail-based financial services.  The company offers consumers financial products and services through  retailer locations including Walmart, Walgreens, CVS/pharmacy, Rite Aid, Kmart, Kroger, 7-ELEVEN, Ralphs, Fred Meyer, Smiths and Radio Shack.  Green Dot's products include Green Dot MasterCardÂ® and VisaÂ® branded prepaid debit cards and the Green Dot MoneyPakÂ® - a cash processing gateway that provides a way for consumers to load cash to prepaid cards, use cash to make purchases and pay bills, and add cash to a variety of accounts including PayPal.   Green Dot is a leading prepaid financial services company providing simple, low-cost and convenient money management solutions to a broad base of U.S. consumers. They believe that they are the leading provider of general purpose reloadable prepaid debit cards in the United States and that their Green Dot Network is the leading prepaid reload network in the United States. They sell their cards and offer their reload services nationwide at approximately 50,000 retail store locations, which provide consumers convenient access to their products and services. Their technology platform, Green PlaNET, provides essential functionality, including point-of-sale connectivity and interoperability with Visa, MasterCard and other payment or funds transfer networks, and compliance and other capabilities to their Green Dot Network, enabling real-time transactions in a secure environment. The combination of their innovative products, broad retail distribution and proprietary technology creates powerful network effects, which they believe enhance the value they deliver to their customers, retail distributors and other participants in their network.   They were an early pioneer in the development of general purpose reloadable prepaid debit cards, or GPR cards, and associated reload services, which collectively they refer to as prepaid financial services. GPR cards are designed for general spending purposes and can be used anywhere the cards' applicable payment network, such as Visa or MasterCard, is accepted, but, unlike gift cards, can be reloaded with additional funds for ongoing, long-term use. Their GPR cards are issued as Visa- or MasterCard-branded cards and are accepted worldwide by merchants and other businesses belonging to the applicable payment network, including for bill payments, online shopping, everyday store purchases and ATM withdrawals. They believe that they are the leading provider of GPR cards in the United States based on the 3.4 million active cards in their portfolio as of March 31, 2010, which they define as cards that have had a purchase, reload or ATM withdrawal transaction during the previous 90-day period.   They have built strong distribution and marketing relationships with many significant retail chains, including Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid, 7-Eleven, Kroger, K-Mart, Meijer and Radio Shack. These retail chains provide consumers with convenient locations to purchase and reload their cards. In addition, any holder of a GPR card issued by a member of their reload network may reload that card at any one of those locations. Currently, there are over 100 third-party prepaid card programs that use their nationwide reload network to facilitate reloading by their cardholders. In 2009, they entered into an agreement with PayPal whereby its customers can add funds to any new or existing PayPal account through their reload network at all retail locations where they sell their products and services, but to date they have not generated significant operating revenues from their relationship with PayPal. In fiscal 2009, the gross dollar volume loaded to their GPR card and reload products was $4.7 billion, an increase of 67% over fiscal 2008.   They have developed a business model with powerful network effects. Growth in the number of their product and service offerings or their network participants, which include consumers, retail distributors and businesses that accept reloads or payments through the Green Dot Network, enhances the value they deliver to all network participants. Their technology platform, Green PlaNET, enables network participants to communicate and complete transactions rapidly and securely through their reload network or third-party payment or funds transfer networks, and is a central component of their network-based business model.;522298 - All Other Nondepository Credit Intermediation;Estados Unidos de América;1;0

1342;KEMET CORPORATION;1.0;1199926000.0;14850.0;KEMET Corporation, as we know it today, was officially formed on December 21, 1990. However, the history of KEMET actually began a long time ago.  Kemet Laboratories was established by Union Carbide Corporation in 1919 to purchase the Cooper Research Company of Cleveland, Ohio, which had invented a promising high-temperature alloy. The name ''KEMET'' is a blend of the words ''chemical'' and ''metallurgy.'' KEMET's first product used this high-temperature alloy for grid wires in vacuum tubes. In 1930, the product line was expanded to include barium-aluminum alloy getters, an essential element in vacuum tubes.  KEMET's development of automatic machinery allowed production of high-quality getters in the huge quantities needed to match the rapid expansion of vacuum tube usage. In fact, it is estimated that over 80% of the vacuum tubes used by the Allies during World War II contained KEMET getters.  The business continued to grow and prosper until the early 1950s when Bell Telephone Laboratories invented the transistor. As the transistor began to displace vacuum tubes in electronics, the getter business stagnated. Fortunately for KEMET, Bell Laboratories had also invented the solid tantalum capacitor, which complemented the use of low-voltage transistors (semi-conductors) in electrical circuits. Since Union Carbide had experience in the fields of high-temperature metals and alloys, the solid tantalum capacitor was chosen as KEMET's ''new product'' to complement the getter product line and to provide the vehicle for future growth.;334416 - Capacitor, Resistor, Coil, Transformer, and Other Inductor Manufacturing;China,Hong Kong,Canadá,Japón,Suecia,Italia,AlemaniaSuiza,Francia,Finlandia,Reino Unido,PortugalMéxicoSingapur,Estados Unidos de América;15;1

This is partially due to its unique approach to education, which stresses the importance of independent study. Princetonâ€™s undergraduate academics grant bachelorâ€™s degrees in the arts and sciences. In their third and fourth years, all undergraduates must pursue independent research in their chosen field of study. Depending on your major and academic goals, this can vary from a lab research to a creative project. The graduate school at Princeton University offers a variety of masterâ€™s degrees and Ph.D.â€™s, as well as continuing education programs to suit diverse academic needs. The graduate school does not use a credit-based system, and your department and advisor will determine your curriculum. Tuition at Princeton is among the most expensive in the country. In light of this, the university aims to support its students with significant financial assistance. Princetonâ€™s need-based financial aid program replaces loans with grants, so that its students wonâ€™t be overwhelmed with debt after graduation. These programs and more are available to those who qualify. Tuition costs shouldnâ€™t discourage qualified students to apply to Princeton.

1505;UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA;1.0;50607332.0;683.0;University of Virginia is an educational institution that offers undergraduate, graduate, postgraduate, and professional degree programs in the fields of architecture, arts, sciences, law, medicine, and nursing.  The schools of the university include School of Architecture, College of Arts and Sciences, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, School of Law, School of Medicine, McIntire School of Commerce, Darden Graduate School of Business Administration, and School of Nursing.  The university offers 51 bachelor's degrees in 47 fields, 84 master's degrees in 67 fields, 6 educational specialist degrees, two first-professional degrees (law and medicine), and 57 doctoral degrees in 55 fields. Affiliated with 7 Nobel laureates, it has produced 5 NASA astronauts, 7 Marshall scholars, 4 Churchill scholars, 29 Truman scholars, and 50 Rhodes scholars.  Thomas Jefferson founded the University of Virginia in 1819. He wished the publicly-supported school to have a national character and stature. It is the first non-sectarian university in the United States and the first to use the elective course system.  Jefferson considered the founding of the university to be one of his greatest achievements. Undertaking the project toward the end of his life after a long and illustrious career that included serving as a colonial revolutionary, political leader, writer, architect, inventor, and horticulturalist, he was closely involved in the university's design. He planned the curriculum, recruited the first faculty, and designed the Academical Village, a terraced green space surrounded by residential and academic buildings, gardens, and the majestic center-point, the Rotunda. The most recognizable symbol of the university, the Rotunda stands at the north end of the Lawn and is half the height and width of the Pantheon in Rome which was the primary inspiration for the building. The Lawn and the Rotunda have served as models for similar designs of centralized green areas at universities across the United States.  The university was opened for classes in 1825 with a faculty of eight and a student body numbering sixty-eight. Jefferson took great pains to recruit the most highly qualified faculty, five of whom were found in England and three in the United States. Instructions were offered in ancient languages, modern languages, mathematics, moral philosophy, natural philosophy, chemistry, law, and medicine.  Jefferson opposed the granting of degrees on the grounds that they were â€˜artificial embellishmentsâ€™. In 1824, however, the Board of Visitors authorized granting the Master of Arts degree. The Doctor of Medicine or M.D. was awarded to the first graduates of the School of Medicine in 1828 and the Bachelor of Law degree or LL.B. was first awarded for law school graduates in 1842. The bachelor's degree was awarded beginning in 1849, but became the standard undergraduate degree and a prerequisite for the master's degree in 1899 bringing the university into conformity with other institutions of higher learning. The PhD has been awarded since 1883.;611310 - Colleges, Universities, and Professional Schools;Estados Unidos de América;1;0

1554;PEOPLE POWER;1.0;30000000.0;30.0;People Power is a B2B software company that is leading the transformation of home care by adding high-tech to a traditionally high-touch industry. With patent-pending AI-powered smart home services, People Power's large telco and home care agency channel partners earn new sources of recurring revenue while accessing a currently unreachable segment of the home care market. Winner of a $4.5M SBIR grant from the National Institutes of Health to produce smart homes that assist caregivers of persons with dementia and Alzheimer's, People Power collaborates with institutions such as U.C. Berkeley and Georgia Tech to gain insights that other companies simply cannot obtain. What's more, the underlying technology platform enables 3rd party developers and researchers to deploy their own recurring revenue services while empowering People Power to advance its AI services capabilities at a rate that is 16x faster than any other company in this space. People Power's technology begins with easy-to-scale software-only solutions for home care agencies and families. Agencies gain a single solution to manage their full operational workflows including caregiver-client matchmaking services, scheduling, billing, HR, EVV, ADL's, and more. Family caregivers gain tools that connect them with other caregivers and experts while also bringing their families back together in a way that distributes the stress of caregiving. People Power's unique family-centric design philosophy is today helping solve the very largest problem facing seniors and their caregivers: depression caused by social isolation and loneliness. With added smart home sensors and a menu of complex time-series AI services, People Power's solution fills critical blind spots in understanding client lifestyle behaviors to deliver awareness, meaningful alerts, and justification for upselling the appropriate level of professional caregiving. As a result, home care agencies effectively decouple their ability to scale from their current limitations on human capital. As the population of seniors that need care is quickly growing far beyond the number of available caregivers, the solutions that People Power produces are inevitable to prevent a global catastrophe.

2028;MOLLER INTERNATIONAL;1.0;500000.0;1.0;Moller International was founded in 1983 as a spin-off of Moller Corporation to continue to design, develop, manufacture and market personal vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (VTOL). The company has developed and integrated the disparate technologies required for small, powered-lift VTOL aircraft. These include electronic stabilization and control systems, efficient ducted fan designs, thrust vectoring mechanisms and aerodynamically stable composite airframe structures. The single most significant spin-off technology is the Rotapower engine, a Wankel rotary engine. This engine is now produced and marketed by Freedom Motors.  Their purpose is to develop and put into use personal transport vehicles that are as safe, efficient, affordable, and easy-to-use as automobiles. These would not be constrained by existing transportation networks, and will provide quick and convenient transport to any destination better than any alternative.  This vehicle should have a low environmental impact in terms of noise, emissions, and fuel consumption. Total costs of ownership over the life of the vehicle, including purchase price, operating costs and infrastructure costs should be reasonably low. This would be competing with such alternatives as personal or mass transport vehicles, general aviation, commercial air travel, and rail or motor vehicles.;541330 - Engineering Services;Estados Unidos de América;1;0
